# time-series-data-analysis-for-finance

Analyzed 2 years of historical price data for NSE companies using Python and data analysis techniques to evaluate real-time stock market data.

Observed a general decline in stock performance across companies due to the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Concluded that stocks consistently outperforming the S&P 500 (CIPLA.NS, ICICIBANK.NS, Reliance.NS, TCS.NS) could be potential long-term investments based on historical performance.
